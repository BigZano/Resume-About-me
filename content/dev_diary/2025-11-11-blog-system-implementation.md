# The Whole Site Received a Facelift!

Just finished implementing a blog system, aptly called the Dev Diary, along with giving the site a new design based around a more muted version of the Salamanders from 40K. Ended up creating two entirely new generator files for the blog and landing page, but I'm exxtremely pleased with how things have turned out so far. The CSS was decently tricky to figure out, as I'm not the least bit front end oriented - however with time and persistence I was able to figure it out. The hover effects and organization is something that I'm particularly fond of, as it just added a bit of extra life to the site. This has been a really fun way to incorporate my interests, and still create something that looks professional at the end of the day. 

## New Features

- **Automatic timestamps** using `<!-- page-date: YYYY-MM-DD -->` comments
- **Index page generation** showing all posts chronologically
- **Persistent Custom theming** with green/orange accent colors
- **Excerpt preview** from first paragraph
- **Interest buttons** on title page with hyper links to each interest
- **Title Page** with navigation options to each portion of the site
