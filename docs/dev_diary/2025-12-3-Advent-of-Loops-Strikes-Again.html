total_joltage = 0

banks = bank.strip().rstrip(',')
digits = [int(ch) for ch in banks if ch.isdigit()]

k = 12  # digits to turn per bank

for bank in list_of_banks:

</code></pre><p>Remembered to snag part one and two this time, and this one was a bit more tough. Finding the right combinations of digits was tough but I eventually got there in the end. Pretty sure it's O(n), which is mid but loads better than yesterday where it was exponential time lol. Got there with a bunch of loops, and was inspired to make the meme below 😁.</p><p><img src="../loops.png" alt="May I have some loops?"></img></p><p><a href="../dev_diary.html" class="back-button">← Back to Blog</a></p></div></article>
